# Faces-generation-with-GANs

## Project Overview

This project is PROJECT 3 of my Deep learning class at UDACITY. In this project, I built two neural network compete against each each other to generate new faces image from CelebA which is a large-scale face attributes dataset with more than 200K celebrity images.

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are algorithmic architectures that use two neural networks, pitting one against the other (thus the “adversarial”) in order to generate new, synthetic instances of data that can pass for real data. They are used widely in image generation, video generation and voice generation.

## Setup

This project requires GPU acceleration to run efficiently. Support is available to use either of the following two methods for accessing GPU-enabled cloud computing resources.

## Udacity Workspaces (Recommended)

Udacity Workspaces provide remote connection to GPU-enabled instances right from the classroom. Refer to the classroom lesson for this project to find an overview of navigating & using Jupyter notebook Workspaces.

## Google COlab(Optional)

Colaboratory, or "Colab" for short, allows you to write and execute Python in your browser, with

> - Zero configuration required
> - Free access to GPUs
> - Easy sharing

## Install

> - Python 3
> - NumPy
> - TensorFlow 1.x
> - Keras 2.x
